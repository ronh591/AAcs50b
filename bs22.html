                <h1 class="custom-heading">Drawing for Design</h1>
                <p class="custom-text">We’re strong believers in getting visual at <strong>IDEO.org</strong>, and drawing
                    is a great way to learn from the people you’re designing for. Whether it’s you with the pen or them, a
                    quick sketch, a graph, or a timeline is a fantastic way to bridge language barriers and keep a record
                    of your research. Drawing can also help the person you’re designing for organize her thoughts visually
                    and generally spur ideas and conversation in a different way than talking. For example, you may ask
                    someone to draw everything they spend money on in a week, or map out all the jobs they’ve had, or show
                    you the route they take to their job. And remember, you don’t need to be a great artist for drawing to
                    be a highly useful tool.

            <h2 class="custom-subheading">Steps</h2>

                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>Make sure you have pen and paper handy when talking with the people you’re designing for. Even a
                        sheet torn out of your notebook works great.</li>
                    <li>When you want the person you’re designing for to draw something, give them a clear idea of what
                        you’re after. A map of their daily route? A timeline of their annual income? What percentage of
                        their fields are dedicated to a certain crop?</li>
                    <li>The person you’re designing for may feel intimidated or that she’s not a good artist. Help her
                        over that fear. Or be the one to draw first so that she doesn’t feel embarrassed.</li>
                    <li>You can use the drawings as Conversation Starters. This Method can get you to a deeper
                        understanding of the person you’re designing for so investigate what they’ve drawn.
                    </li>
